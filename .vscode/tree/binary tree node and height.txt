Binary tree 

max nodes=2^(h+1)
min node = (h+1)
min height=[log2(n+1)]-1
max height=n-1;

Fully Binary tree 

max nodes=2^(h+1)
min node = (2h+1)
min height=[log2(n+1)]-1
max height=(n-1)/2;

Complete Binary tree 

max nodes=2^(h+1)
min node = 2^h
min height=[log2(n+1)]-1
max height=log n


// if we want to store the binary tree in the array, then the formula for finding the child and parent is listed here;;;;
If the node is at the ith index then:::

Left child would be at (2*i)+1
right chid would be at (2*i)+2
parent would be at (i-1)/2;
